Task3 

The first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ... and so on. Define two functions fibRec and fibIter that return the number at the ith index.

Acceptance criteria:
All tests pass.
Parameter validation is performed.
fibRec creates a linearly recursive process.
fibIter creates a linearly iterative process.
Explain the wildcard symbol (_).
Explain pattern matching
